          <h2>1. Information We Collect</h2>
          
          <h3>Protected Health Information (PHI)</h3>

        <div className="section">
          <h2>2. How We Use Information</h2>
          <p>EnScribe uses collected information solely for the following purposes:</p>
          <ul>
            <li><strong>Transcription Services:</strong> Converting audio recordings into accurate text transcriptions</li>
            <li><strong>SOAP Note Generation:</strong> Creating structured medical documentation from transcribed content</li>
            <li><strong>Service Improvement:</strong> Enhancing transcription accuracy and system performance</li>

            <li><strong>Security Monitoring:</strong> Detecting and preventing unauthorized access</li>
            <li><strong>Legal Compliance:</strong> Meeting regulatory requirements and responding to legal requests</li>
          </ul>
        </div>

        <div className="section">
          <h2>3. HIPAA Compliance</h2>
          <div className="highlight-box">
            <p className="important">Enscribe operates as a Business Associate under HIPAA and maintains strict compliance with all applicable regulations.</p>
          </div>
          
          <h3>Security Safeguards</h3>
          <ul>
            <li><strong>PHI Masking:</strong> Audio recordings are processed using AWS Comprehend Medical under a HIPAA Business Associate Agreement to automatically detect and remove identifiable patient information before any further processing</li>
            <li><strong>Encryption:</strong> All PHI is encrypted both in transit and at rest using advanced encryption techniques (see Section 7 for details)</li>
            <li><strong>Access Controls:</strong> Multi-factor authentication and role-based access restrictions</li>
            <li><strong>Audit Logging:</strong> Comprehensive logging of all system access and PHI handling</li>
            <li><strong>Staff Training:</strong> Regular HIPAA compliance training for all personnel</li>
            <li><strong>Risk Assessments:</strong> Ongoing security evaluations and vulnerability testing</li>
          </ul>

          <h3>Minimum Necessary Standard</h3>
          <p>We limit access to PHI to the minimum amount necessary to accomplish the intended purpose, ensuring that only authorized personnel can access patient information relevant to their specific job functions.</p>
        </div>

        <div className="section">
          <h2>4. Data Sharing and Disclosure</h2>
          <p><strong>Core Principle:</strong> We do not send any data that may reasonably identify a patient to vendors who do not have HIPAA Business Associate Agreements.</p>
          
          <p>Enscribe does <strong>NOT</strong> sell, rent, or share PHI with third parties except in the following limited circumstances:</p>
          
          <ul>
            <li><strong>Healthcare Providers:</strong> Returning processed transcriptions and SOAP notes to the originating healthcare provider</li>
            <li><strong>Business Associates under HIPAA Agreements:</strong>
              <ul>
                <li>Amazon Web Services (AWS) - Backend infrastructure (EC2), storage (S3/CloudFront), AWS Comprehend Medical for PHI masking, and AWS Bedrock for LLM processing</li>
                <li>Deepgram - Transcription processing services</li>
                <li>Supabase - Encrypted data storage for transcripts and SOAP notes</li>
              </ul>
            </li>
            <li><strong>Data Processing:</strong> Patient-identifiable information is masked using AWS Comprehend Medical before being processed by any third-party services</li>
            <li><strong>Legal Requirements:</strong> When required by law, court order, or regulatory authority</li>
            <li><strong>Emergency Situations:</strong> To prevent serious harm to patient safety when legally permitted</li>
          </ul>

          <p>We maintain HIPAA Business Associate Agreements with applicable vendors and require appropriate safeguards and contractual protections for any vendor involved in PHI processing.</p>
        </div>

        <div className="section">
          <h2>5. Data Retention and Deletion</h2>
          <ul>
            <li><strong>Audio Recordings:</strong> Securely deleted within 30 days after transcription completion unless otherwise specified by the healthcare provider</li>
            <li><strong>Transcriptions and SOAP Notes:</strong> Retained according to the healthcare provider's specified retention policy, typically 7-10 years</li>
            <li><strong>System Logs:</strong> Maintained for 12 months for security and audit purposes</li>
            <li><strong>Account Information:</strong> Deleted within 90 days of account closure</li>
          </ul>
        </div>

        <div className="section">
          <h2>6. Your Rights</h2>
          <p>As a patient whose information may be processed through Enscribe, you have the following rights:</p>
          
          <ul>
            <li><strong>Access:</strong> Request access to your PHI that we process</li>
            <li><strong>Amendment:</strong> Request correction of inaccurate PHI</li>
            <li><strong>Restriction:</strong> Request limitations on how your PHI is used</li>
            <li><strong>Accounting:</strong> Receive an accounting of PHI disclosures</li>
            <li><strong>Complaint:</strong> File complaints about our privacy practices</li>
          </ul>
          
          <p><em>Note: These rights must typically be exercised through your healthcare provider, as they are the covered entity responsible for your medical records.</em></p>

        <div className="section">
          <h2>7. Encryption and Data Protection</h2>
          
          <h3>Multi-Layer Encryption Approach</h3>
          <p>EnScribe uses a hybrid encryption scheme to protect different types of patient data:</p>
          
          <h4>Patient Records & Medical Information</h4>
          <ul>
            <li>Each patient record is encrypted using industry-standard 256-bit encryption</li>
            <li>The encryption keys themselves are additionally secured with an extra layer of protection</li>
            <li>Every patient's information receives its own unique encryption key for individual-level protection</li>
          </ul>
          
          <h4>Login & Account Security</h4>
          <ul>
            <li>Access tokens are encrypted and additionally secured with advanced hashing techniques</li>
            <li>This prevents unauthorized access even if someone obtained the encrypted tokens</li>
          </ul>
          
          <h4>Medical Transcripts (PHI Protection)</h4>
          <ul>
            <li>Before storage, AWS Comprehend Medical automatically identifies and masks sensitive patient information (names, dates, medical record numbers)</li>
            <li>Patient-identifiable information is replaced with secure tokens</li>
            <li>Only de-identified transcripts are processed by downstream services</li>
          </ul>
          
          <h4>Data Storage</h4>
          <ul>
            <li>All encrypted data is stored securely in Supabase with AES encryption at rest</li>
            <li>Audio recordings are stored in encrypted Supabase Storage buckets</li>
            <li>Encryption keys are stored securely and only accessible by authorized systems</li>
          </ul>
          
          <p>We follow HIPAA guidelines to ensure the confidentiality and security of information throughout the entire EnScribe platform.</p>
